This is a MATLAB program written to complete research project at CQCL (summer 2015). To start playing with it, type "loadconstraints" followed by "example" in the MATLAB command window. The main program is "automp". I aim to make this repository more understandable. Currently the algorithm used is also sub-optimal.
